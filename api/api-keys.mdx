## Overview

Use this quickstart to create a key and make your first request in minutes.

<Card title="Rate limits" icon="gauge">
  All API keys are limited to **1,000 requests per day**. Contact us if you need higher limits.
</Card>

## 1) Create an API key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable developer mode">
    Navigate to your [Evento settings](https://evento.so/settings) and enable **Developer Mode** in your profile settings.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access API keys section">
    Once Developer Mode is enabled, go to [Settings → Developer → API Keys](https://evento.so/settings/developer).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create new API key">
    Click **"Create API Key"** and provide a descriptive name for your key (e.g., "Production App", "Development", "MCP Server").
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy your key">
    Your API key will be displayed **only once**. Copy it immediately and store it securely.
    
    <Warning>
      You cannot retrieve the key again after closing the dialog. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new one.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 2) Make your first request

```bash
curl https://evento.so/api/public/v1/events/evt_abc123 \
  -H "x-evento-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

If the event exists and is public, the response includes `success: true` and an event object in `data`.

## 3) Key management

### Key limits

- Maximum of **10 active API keys** per user
- Each key can be named for easy identification
- Keys can be revoked at any time

### Revoking keys

If a key is compromised or no longer needed:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API keys">
    Go to [Settings → Developer → API Keys](https://evento.so/settings/developer)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Find the key">
    Locate the key you want to revoke in the list
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Revoke">
    Click the **"Revoke"** button next to the key. This action is immediate and irreversible.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Revoking a key will immediately invalidate all requests using that key. Make sure to update your applications before revoking keys in production.
</Info>

## 4) Security best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Never commit keys" icon="code">
    Don't commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables instead.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Rotate regularly" icon="rotate">
    Create new keys and revoke old ones periodically to maintain security.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use separate keys" icon="layer-group">
    Use different keys for development, staging, and production environments.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Monitor usage" icon="chart-line">
