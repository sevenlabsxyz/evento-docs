The Evento API provides a simple way to access public event data. With just one endpoint, you can retrieve all public events associated with any username on the Evento platform.

<Info>
The Evento API uses RESTful principles and returns JSON responses with a structured wrapper. All data returned is from public events created by the specified user.

## API Overview

The Evento API is designed with simplicity in mind:

- **Single Endpoint**: One endpoint to get all public events created by a username  
- **Query Parameter**: Username passed as a query parameter for flexibility
- **Structured Responses**: JSON responses with success, message, and data wrapper
- **Public Events Only**: Access only to published, publicly visible events

<Note>
The API provides read-only access to public events created by users. It returns all published events where visibility = "public" - no RSVP filtering is applied.
</Note>

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key.

<Warning>
You must include your API key in the `x-evento-api-key` header for all requests.
