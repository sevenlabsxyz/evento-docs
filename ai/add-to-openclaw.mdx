## Overview

If you are leaning into the recent wave of personal AI agents, OpenClaw is one of the simplest ways to run one locally and keep control of your own environment.

The Evento MCP skill can be reused directly in OpenClaw by placing the same `SKILL.md` file into OpenClaw's skills workspace.

Canonical skill source:

- `https://github.com/andreneves/evento-public-mcp/blob/main/SKILL.md`

## Why OpenClaw for this

Based on OpenClaw's public docs and README, it is:

- Open source and self-hosted
- Designed for personal AI assistant workflows
- Set up with an onboarding flow (`openclaw onboard --install-daemon`)
- Compatible with filesystem-based skills (`~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`)

## Add Evento skill to OpenClaw

Create a skill folder in your OpenClaw workspace and copy the Evento skill file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/evento-public-mcp
cp /absolute/path/to/evento-public-mcp/SKILL.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/evento-public-mcp/SKILL.md
```

If OpenClaw is already running, restart your session/gateway so the new skill is picked up.
